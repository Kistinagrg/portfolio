          My name is Kistina Gurung and I am a fullstack developer based in New
          York City, New York. I am passionate about Web Development, and strive
          to better myself as a developer and the development community as a
          whole. Always hungry to learn more about the world (or in general), I
          look forward in bringing my focused drive to empower teams and shape
          the future for the greater good. Currently, I am seeking a fulltime
          Software Engineer role and is open to collobrations of different
          projects.

          In my free time, you can catch me watching binge-watching movies or
          playing games.
